<h3>7 BASIC RULES</h3>

<ol>
    <li>There are six players for each team on the field at a time.</li>
    <li>You can only pass backwards.</li>
    <li>If you get touched with the ball, you have to put the ball on the ground and step over it.</li>
    <li>The person who collects the ball, known as the ‘dummy half’, should try to offload quickly because they’re not allowed to get touched or score. If they do, it’s a ‘changeover’ (the ball goes to the other team).</li>
    <li>The team that makes the touch has to get back seven metres before they can make another touch.</li>
    <li>After six touches to a team, there’s a changeover.</li>
    <li>The ball can’t touch the ground. If it does, it’s a changeover.</li>
</ol>
